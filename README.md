## Tech Stack

**Front End**

- React: functional components + hooks
- Styled Components

**Backend**

- Firebase: authentication, storage bucket and firestore

**Reasoning**

We had all completed several bootcamp projects using React and wanted to now test our React skills without the course guides. Also, given the time constraints it made sense to use something we were familiar with. We had just learnt about styled components and liked how this approach tends towards modularity.

While we chose React for its familiarity, we chose Firebase in order to explore something new. With an eye on the time we had been given for this project (2-3 weeks), we hoped Firebase would simplify creating and accessing a database and user authentication.
